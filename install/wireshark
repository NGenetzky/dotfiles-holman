# Dumpcap can be installed in a way that allows members of the "wireshark" system group to capture
# packets. This is recommended over the alternative of running Wireshark/Tshark directly as root, because
# less of the code will run with elevated privileges.
#
# For more detailed information please see /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian.
#
# Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by default. If in doubt, it is suggested
# to leave it disabled.
#
# Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?

apt install wireshark
# dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
